Differences in   Actual Paper(A)                             vs                          My Implementation(B)

* (A)It uses a Dirichlet-multinomial data generating process for selection         vs (B) It uses mean and std deviation of fantasy pts and generates data on that . 


* (A)It uses Binary Quadratic Program Technique to optimize the result           vs (B) It simply choses the max probability from the result and choses as the best
